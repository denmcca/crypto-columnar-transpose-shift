Uses columnar transposition and Ceaser Shift algorithms to decrypt the following cipher:
KUHPVIBQKVOSHWHXBPOFUXHRPVLLDDWVOSKWPREDDVVIDWQRBHBGLLBBPKQUNRVOHQEIRLWOKKRDD


The description of the encryption method goes as such:
1. The encryption/decryption algorithm is a combination of columnar transposition and simple shift substitution
2. The key length is less than or equal to 10 letters long
3. The original message is in English
4. The original message contains only letters (i.e., no punctuation marks, numbers, etc).
